===============================
Google Benchmark action for C++
===============================

This is Steinwurf's public Google Benchmark action.

The action provides a Github Action for continuous benchmarking.
If your project has a C++ benchmark with Google Benchmark, this action collects data from the benchmark outputs
and monitor the results on GitHub Actions workflow.

Usage
-----

This action takes a file that contains benchmark output. One can push this output to a different repository (e.g a benchmark "dump") and
the action compares the current output in the directory with the output from the new commit.

Heres a minimal setup example. You can replace the waf configure/build step with whatever build system you use:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Minimal setup
    on:
        push:

    jobs:
        benchmark:
            name: Performance Regression Check
            runs-on: [self-hosted, benchmark]
            steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v2
                # Configure with waf
                - name: Configure in no-debug
                    run: python3 waf Configure
                # Build the binaries
                - name: Build
                    run: python3 waf
                # Run Google Benchmark with and stores the output to a file
                - name: Run benchmark
                    run: /path/to/benchmark/binary --benchmark_out='output.json'
                # Run `github-action-benchmark` action
                - name: Compare benchmark result
                    uses: steinwurf/gbenchmark-action@v1
                    with:
                    # What repository are you benchmarking
                    name: Awesome Repo Benchmark
                    # Where the output from the benchmark is stored
                    output-file-path: path/to/output.json
                    # The name of the dump-repository containing the previous benchmark
                    gh-repository: "your-name/dump-repo"
                    # The branch of the dump-repository containing the previous benchmark
                    gh-branch: "master"
                    # Where the previous data file is stored
                    benchmark-data-dir-path: /dump-repo/awesome-repo
                    # Workflow will fail when an alert happens
                    fail-on-alert: true
